# geo[metry]
## description
An interface-oriented implementation of geometric and geometric-like (python) types.
## philosophy
The library attempts to describe geometry (in order of preference) with:

 1. Correctness
 2. Logical, consistent and intuitive interface
 3. Efficiency (speed)
 4. No attempt to hide internal implementations (efficiency)
